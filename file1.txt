GitHub Copilot: GitHub Copilot

Short definitions and the differences — concise, practical.

- Git
  - Definition: A distributed version-control system for tracking changes in files and coordinating work on source code.
  - Scope: Runs locally; stores commits, branches, tags in a local repository (.git folder).
  - Typical commands: init, clone, add, commit, branch, merge, push, pull.
  - Gotcha: Git itself is storage + history; remote hosting is separate.

- Bash
  - Definition: A Unix shell and command language (Bourne Again SHell). It interprets commands and runs scripts.
  - Scope: Provides a command-line environment (run programs, chain commands, write shell scripts).
  - Typical usage: running git commands, automating tasks, manipulating files.
  - Gotcha: Bash is not a VCS — it’s the tool you use to call git or other programs.

- GitHub
  - Definition: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories with collaboration features (PRs, issues, code review).
  - Scope: Remote repo hosting, web UI, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), package registry, social/collaboration features.
  - Typical: Public open-source hosting; strong community and integrations.
  - Gotcha: “GitHub” is the service — you still use Git locally; GitHub enforces auth (PATs, OAuth).

- GitLab
  - Definition: A web-based Git repository manager offering repo hosting plus built-in CI/CD, issue tracking, and more.
  - Scope: Similar to GitHub but with integrated CI/CD (GitLab CI), strong self-hosting options (CE/EE).
  - Typical: Teams wanting an all-in-one DevOps platform or self-hosted control.
  - Gotcha: Terminology: GitLab uses “Merge Request” where GitHub calls it “Pull Request.”

Key differences (quick):
- Git vs GitHub/GitLab: Git = tool; GitHub/GitLab = services that host Git repositories and add collaboration/CI features.
- Bash vs Git: Bash = shell for running commands/scripts; Git = the version-control program you usually run from a shell.
- GitHub vs GitLab: Both host Git repositories; GitHub has large OSS community and many integrations; GitLab emphasizes built-in CI/CD and easy self-hosting.

Quick examples (commands you’ll use):

````bash
# create a repo locally, make first commit, push to remote
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
````

````bash
# small bash script (run from shell)
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
git status --short
````

Recommended learning path:
1. Learn basic Git workflow locally (clone, branch, commit, merge, push).
2. Use Bash to run/git automate commands and write small scripts.
3. Pick GitHub or GitLab depending on team needs (community + integrations vs integrated CI/self-hosting).

If you want, tell me whether you prefer GUI or CLI and I’ll give a 5-step cheat-sheet tailored to that.
